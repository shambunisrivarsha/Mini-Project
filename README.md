Developed a web-based application using Flask (Python) to visually demonstrate various sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and more. The application allows users to input data and watch real-time visualizations of sorting processes, helping to understand algorithm efficiency and behavior. The project includes an interactive interface and highlights the time complexity of each algorithm, providing an educational tool for learners and enthusiasts.
